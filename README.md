### Hi, my name is Peerat (Ping) 
- Currently, I'm a Research Fellow at AI Singapore. Developing multilingual LLMs and benchmarks.
- Before that, I was a Ph.D. student (5-year program) at VISTEC, Natural Language Processing and Representation Learning Lab (NRL). My supervisor and co-advisor were Assoc. Prof. Dr. Sarana Nutanong (VISTEC, Thailand) and Dr. Ekapol Chuangsuwanich (CU, Thailand).
- My research fields are Natural Language Processing (question answering, semantic understanding, and entity linking), Information Retrieval (search and representation learning), Modeling (knowledge distillation, model efficiency, LLMs, and multilingual learning), and Benchmarking (cultural evaluation, LLM-as-a-judge, and datasets).
